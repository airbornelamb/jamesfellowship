We admitted we were powerless over our sexual addictions and sexually compulsive behaviors, that our lives had become unmanageable.<dd><em>Romans 7:18 "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>2. We came to believe that Jesus Christ's power at work in us could restore us to sanity.<dd><em>Philippians 2:13 "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>3. We made a decision to turn our lives and our wills over to the care of God.<dd><em>Romans 12:1 "I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,which is your spiritual worship"</em></dd><br></dt><dt>4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<dd><em>Lamentations 3:40 "Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the Lord"</em></dd><br></dt><dt>5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<dd><em>James 5:16 "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<dd><em>James 4:10 "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>7. We humbly asked Him to remove all our shortcomings.<dd><em>1 John 1:9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.<dd><em>Luke 6:31 "And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>9. We made direct amends to such people whenever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.<dd><em>Matthew 5:23-24 "So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave you gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>10. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.<dd><em>1 Corinthians 10:12 "Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>11. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and power to carry that out.<dd><em>Colossians 3:16 "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God."</em></dd><br></dt><dt>12. Having had a spiritual experience as the result of these steps, we try to carry this message to others and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<dd><em>Galatians 6:1 "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."</em></dd><br></dt></dl></section></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><ul><li><a href="index.html">Homepage</a></li><li> <a href="intro.html">Introduction</a></li><li><span class="opener active">Steps</span><ul><li> <a href="step1.html">One</a></li><li> <a href="step2.html">Two</a></li><li> <a href="step3.html">Three</a></li><li> <a href="step4.html">Four</a></li><li> <a href="step5.html">Five</a></li><li> <a href="step6.html">Six</a></li><li> <a href="step7.html">Seven</a></li><li> <a href="step8.html">Eight</a></li><li> <a href="step9.html">Nine</a></li><li><a href="step10.html">Ten</a></li><li><a href="step11.html">Eleven</a></li><li><a href="step12.html">Twelve</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="meetingformat.html">Meeting Format</a></li><!-- li// a(href='mentors.html') Mentor Section--></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">Image Credit: <a href="https://unplash.com"> Unsplash</a>
